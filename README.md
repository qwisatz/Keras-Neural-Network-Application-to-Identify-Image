# Keras Neural Network Application to Identiy Image


This project will explore neural network models using Keras

A. We will predict earnings from an imaginary company given a list of data with the earnings.
B. We will also use pretrained model to identify images.


This project created using Python 3 and will need the following libraries installed:
1. Tensorflow or keras (creating the neural network model)
2. pandas (for reading CSV file)
3. sklearn (for normalising data)


All the data taken was from the course: 
Building Deep Learning Applications with Keras 2.0 by Adam Geitgey and can be found on this link:
https://www.linkedin.com/learning/building-deep-learning-applications-with-keras-2-0/


# A
1. Read in CSV of trained and test CSV data into pandas
2. Scale the all the data from 0-1
3. Cutput saved data.
4. Create a model of the session.
5. Add in neural network parameters.
6. Add layers, final layer is one output.
7. Add a loss function and loss function.
8. Load in test data and compare to trained model results.
9. Save model.
10. Load a model and predict first value using trained model and a new csv.
11. Use tensorboard to visualise machine learning.

# B
1. Load up the pretrained model, resNet.
2. Load up an image.
3. print out prediction.
